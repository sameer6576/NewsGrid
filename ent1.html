              With the OTT space giving its audience an access to content from
              all around the world, viewers know how to pick the grain from
              chaff. The OTT world and the competition on it has encouraged
              writers, actors and directors to push the envelope and put only
              their best foot forward. While many failed to achieve what they
              dreamt of, some of the series stood out and received immense love
              from the audience. Now that we are six months into 2022, here’s
              the list of the best we had so far.

              Rocket Boys This SonyLIV series proves that science is not boring
              and doesn’t necessarily has to be serious. The Nikkhil Advani
              project is based on the lives of Homi J Bhabha and Vikram
              Sarabhai, excellently performed by Jim Sarbh and Ishwak Singh of
              Pataal Lok fame, respectively. It is dramatic, stays true to the
              timeline and the culture Bhabha and Sarabhai belonged to. Talking
              about the series, Nikkhil Advani told indianexpress.com, “Dr
              Bhabha was the father of atomic energy and Dr Sarabhai Baba was
              the father of space research, but their lives were much more than
              just that. So, when you’d watch Rocket Boys, you will experience
              the period of 1942-1962 in a wholesome manner. It’s not just about
              science, It’s about the people of that period, the culture, the
              art and what these two men did to influence it.”

              2022 was also an year where if crime/thrillers were working, drama and romance were also being hailed equally. The makers of Panchayat 2 had the pressure to perform better than its last season, which was critically acclaimed. But the second season managed to surprise us, and in the good way. Starring Jitendra Kumar, Neena Gupta and Raghubir Yadav in the lead role, Panchayat 2 stuck to its rootedness and simplicity while serving a compelling storyline. This season was yet another proof of how simple yet strong script supported by good performers can take a series/film to another level. In an interview with indianexpress.com, Panchayat 2 director Deepak Kumar Mishra revealed the secret behind the series’ success. “It’s the simplicity. Every other show on the web is talking about violence in the hinterland. With Panchayat, people saw themselves as the characters. I think it’s the relatability and simplicity that did the trick,” he said.
